# Design and Implementation of a Data warehouse

The goal of this project is to design and implement a data warehouse,
we took the company Adventure Works as a case study.
First we went through the design stage to create a data warehouse for the sales
department in order to define the fact and dimension tables, then we moved on
to the implementation stage using Microsoft tools : SSMS for the creation of the
Staging Area and the Datawarehouse, SSIS for the extraction of data from the
source to the Staging Area and then to the Datawarehouse, SSAS for the creation
of the OLAP cubes and finally Power BI for the generation of reports.
This datawarehouse will allow the sales department to have more visibility on
sales for resellers and on the Internet and help them make decisions thanks to the
generated reports.
